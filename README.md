# Sync
Syncs files from one location to another.

Right now the tool is geared towards syncing to a OneDrive folder (effectively syncing
to the cloud).  However, the OneDrive_base can be altered to point to any other directory.  


The *sync_config.yml* may be used as a sample to understand the format for syncing directories.
Avoid typing redundant paths by nesting those in common.
